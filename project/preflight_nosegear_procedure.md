# Procedure: Visual Inspection – Nose Landing Gear  
**ATA Code:** 32-11-00  
**Aircraft:** AMPEL360 BWB-Q100  
**Mode:** Instructor-Guided (Voice + Avatar)  
**Author:** Amedeo Pelliccia  
**Duration:** ~55 seconds  
**Language:** Spanish/English  

---

## Objective
Perform a thorough visual inspection of the nose landing gear assembly to ensure operational safety and airworthiness compliance before flight operations.

---

## Prerequisites
- Aircraft positioned on level ground
- Parking brake engaged
- Wheel chocks properly installed
- Area lighting adequate for inspection
- Q-AVIOGEN instructor avatar active

---

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1 – Aircraft Position Verification
**Duration:** 6.5 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Point to aircraft position  

- Ensure the aircraft is parked on flat, stable ground
- Verify parking brake is fully engaged
- Confirm wheel chocks are properly positioned
- Check for adequate clearance around nose gear area

**Safety Note:** Never perform inspection with engines running or in windy conditions exceeding 25 knots.

---

### Step 2 – Nose Gear Area Clearance
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Gesture around nose gear area  

- Visually scan the area around nose gear for obstacles
- Verify Ground Support Equipment (GSE) is positioned safely
- Check for personnel clearance (minimum 3 meters)
- Ensure no foreign object debris (FOD) present

**Q-Standard:** Maintain situational awareness of all ground traffic.

### Step 3 – Strut Integrity Assessment
**Duration:** 8.0 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Close inspection gesture, point to critical areas  

Perform detailed visual inspection of the nose gear strut:

#### Hydraulic System Check:
- **Leaks:** Look for hydraulic fluid stains or active leaks
- **Pressure:** Verify strut extension appears normal
- **Hoses:** Check for cracks, wear, or loose connections

#### Structural Integrity:
- **Corrosion:** Inspect for rust, pitting, or oxidation
- **Cracks:** Look for stress fractures or fatigue signs
- **Bolts/Fasteners:** Verify all hardware is secure

#### Contamination Assessment:
- **Ice:** Remove any ice accumulation (winter ops)
- **Dirt/Debris:** Clean excessive dirt that could affect operation
- **Chemical:** Check for chemical contamination or staining

---

### Step 4 – Tire and Wheel Inspection
**Duration:** 5.0 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Kneel/crouch to inspect tire  

#### Tire Condition Analysis:
- **Inflation:** Check for proper inflation (visual assessment)
- **Wear Pattern:** Inspect tread for even wear across surface
- **Damage:** Look for cuts, punctures, or embedded objects
- **Sidewall:** Check for bulges, cracks, or aging signs

#### Wheel Assembly:
- **Rim:** Inspect for cracks, corrosion, or damage
- **Valve:** Check tire valve condition and security
- **Hub:** Verify wheel hub shows no signs of overheating

**Limits:** Replace tire if wear indicators are visible or damage exceeds MEL limits.

---

### Step 5 – Steering System Verification
**Duration:** 4.5 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Trace steering linkages with hand  

#### Steering Components:
- **Actuators:** Check hydraulic steering actuators for leaks
- **Linkages:** Verify all mechanical connections are secure
- **Range:** Visually confirm steering mechanism moves freely
- **Hoses:** Inspect hydraulic lines for wear or damage

#### Operational Check:
- **Travel:** Steering should have full range of motion
- **Binding:** No mechanical interference or binding
- **Centering:** Wheel should return to center position

---

### Step 6 – Quantum Sensor Verification (AMPEL360 Specific)
**Duration:** 7.0 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Point to Q-sensor array, show display  

For aircraft equipped with Q-Sensors (Quantum-Enhanced Monitoring):

#### Sensor Array Status:
- **Coherence Level:** Must exceed 0.95 (displayed on MFD)
- **Sync Status:** All sensors showing "SYNC OK"
- **Temperature:** Q-sensor operating within normal range (-10°C to +45°C)

#### Vibration Analysis:
- **Baseline:** Compare current readings to baseline values
- **Anomalies:** No unusual vibration patterns detected
- **Calibration:** Verify last calibration date is current

#### Digital Twin Integration:
- **Data Link:** Confirm Q-sensor data feeding to digital twin
- **Health Status:** All parameters showing green status
- **Predictive:** No maintenance alerts from AI analysis

**Note:** Q-sensor technology provides real-time structural health monitoring for enhanced safety.

---

### Step 7 – Completion and Documentation
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds  
**Avatar Action:** Thumbs up, point to checklist  

#### Checklist Closure:
- **Item Status:** Mark nose gear inspection as "COMPLETE"
- **Findings:** Document any discrepancies or observations
- **Time:** Record inspection completion time
- **Inspector:** Digital signature or initials required

#### Anomaly Reporting:
- **Digital Twin Log:** Report any findings via digital twin interface
- **Maintenance Operations:** Alert Mx Ops for any discrepancies
- **Follow-up:** Schedule corrective action if required
- **Documentation:** Ensure proper record keeping per regulations

#### Final Verification:
- **Overall Assessment:** Nose gear suitable for flight operations
- **Next Inspection:** Confirm next scheduled inspection date
- **Crew Briefing:** Inform flight crew of inspection results
