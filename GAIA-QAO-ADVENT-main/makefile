# Makefile for GAIA-QAO-AdVent Project
#
# Provides a standard, unified interface for common development and operational tasks.
# Run 'make help' to see a list of available commands.

# --- Variables and Configuration ---
# Use the shell to find all service directories that have a Dockerfile.dev
# This makes the Makefile more dynamic.
SERVICES := $(shell find * -maxdepth 1 -type d -print)

# Default shell to bash for more advanced features
SHELL := /bin/bash

# --- Helper for Self-documented Commands ---
# This is a common pattern to make 'help' target work.
# It finds comments starting with ## and prints them.
