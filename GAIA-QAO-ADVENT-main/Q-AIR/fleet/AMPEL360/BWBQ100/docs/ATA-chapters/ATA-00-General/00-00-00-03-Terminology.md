## 1. Introduction

This document provides definitions for technical terms used throughout the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 documentation suite. Terms are organized into categories for ease of reference, with special attention to quantum technologies, Blended Wing Body configurations, and hybrid-electric systems unique to this aircraft.

## 2. General Aviation Terms

### Blended Wing Body (BWB)
An aircraft configuration where the wing and fuselage are smoothly integrated into a single lifting surface, eliminating the distinct boundary between wing and body. In the AMPEL360, this provides enhanced lift distribution and internal volume.

### Center of Pressure (CP)
The point where the total sum of aerodynamic pressure forces acts on an aircraft. In BWB configurations, CP management is critical due to the non-cylindrical pressure vessel design.

### Distributed Propulsion
A propulsion architecture where multiple smaller propulsion units are distributed across the aircraft structure rather than concentrated in traditional nacelles. The AMPEL360 uses hybrid-electric distributed propulsion.

### Elevon
A control surface combining elevator and aileron functions, typical in BWB aircraft. The AMPEL360 features quantum-actuated elevons for enhanced responsiveness.

### Flight Envelope Protection
Automated systems preventing the aircraft from exceeding structural or aerodynamic limits. Enhanced in the AMPEL360 with quantum predictive algorithms.

### Ground Effect
Increased lift and decreased drag when flying close to the ground. BWB configurations experience enhanced ground effect requiring specific handling procedures.

### Load Alleviation
