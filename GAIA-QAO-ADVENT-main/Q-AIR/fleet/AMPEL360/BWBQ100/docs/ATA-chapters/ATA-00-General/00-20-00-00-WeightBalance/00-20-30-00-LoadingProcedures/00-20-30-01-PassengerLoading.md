## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document establishes standardized passenger loading procedures for the AMPEL360 BWBQ100 Blended Wing Body aircraft to ensure:
- Optimal weight and balance throughout loading operations
- Efficient passenger boarding and seat allocation
- Compliance with center of gravity (CG) limits
- Integration with quantum structural monitoring systems
- Minimized turnaround time while maintaining safety

### 1.2 Scope

These procedures apply to all BWBQ100 variants during:
- Normal passenger boarding operations
- Quick turnaround operations
- Special loading scenarios (wheelchair passengers, unaccompanied minors)
- Emergency evacuation reversal procedures

### 1.3 BWB-Specific Considerations

The Blended Wing Body configuration presents unique loading challenges:
- Non-cylindrical pressure vessel affects weight distribution
- Wider cabin requires specific boarding sequences
- Multiple boarding doors enable parallel loading zones
- Quantum Structural Monitoring (QSM) provides real-time load feedback

## 2. Pre-Loading Requirements

### 2.1 System Initialization

Before passenger boarding commences:

1. **Quantum Systems Check**
   - QSM network operational status: VERIFIED
   - Real-time strain monitoring: ACTIVE
   - CG calculation system: ONLINE
   - QPU optimization algorithms: READY

2. **Ground Support Equipment**
   - Jet bridges positioned at designated doors
   - Ground power unit connected
   - Air conditioning pre-conditioned to 22°C ± 2°C
   - Cabin lighting set to "Boarding" mode

3. **Weight & Balance Preparation**
   - Current aircraft empty weight verified
   - Fuel load confirmed and entered into system
   - Cargo/baggage weight recorded
   - Catering and potable water quantities logged

### 2.2 Passenger Manifest Review

Ground operations must provide:
- Total passenger count by zone
- Special assistance requirements
- Distribution of passengers requiring extra time
- Premium vs economy passenger split

## 3. Standard Loading Procedures

### 3.1 Loading Sequence Overview

The BWBQ100 utilizes a **Zone-Based Distributed Loading** system optimized by quantum algorithms:

```
LOADING SEQUENCE MATRIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Zone  | Location      | Rows    | Capacity | Load Order
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Z1    | Aft Center   | 21-24   | 14 pax   | First
Z2    | Mid Aft      | 13-20   | 35 pax   | Second
Z3    | Mid Forward  | 5-12    | 35 pax   | Third
Z4    | Forward      | 1-4     | 16 pax   | Last
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.2 Detailed Zone Loading

#### 3.2.1 Zone 1 - Aft Center (Rows 21-24)
**Boarding Door:** Aft Left (Door 3L)  
**Sequence:** Window → Middle → Aisle  
**Target Time:** 3 minutes  

Rationale: Loading aft section first maintains nose-down attitude during ground operations and optimizes CG progression.

#### 3.2.2 Zone 2 - Mid Aft (Rows 13-20)
**Boarding Door:** Mid Left (Door 2L)  
**Sequence:** Alternating sides, window to aisle  
**Target Time:** 6 minutes  

Special consideration: Heaviest passenger load zone - monitor QSM for asymmetric loading.

#### 3.2.3 Zone 3 - Mid Forward (Rows 5-12)
**Boarding Door:** Mid Left (Door 2L) and Forward Left (Door 1L)  
**Sequence:** Simultaneous dual-door boarding  
**Target Time:** 5 minutes  

Note: Dual-door boarding enabled by BWB wide cabin design.

#### 3.2.4 Zone 4 - Forward Premium (Rows 1-4)
**Boarding Door:** Forward Left (Door 1L)  
**Sequence:** Open seating within zone  
**Target Time:** 2 minutes  

Premium passengers board last for minimal aisle interference.

### 3.3 Real-Time CG Monitoring

Throughout loading, the Quantum Processing Unit continuously:
1. Calculates instantaneous CG position
2. Projects final loaded CG
3. Recommends seat reassignments if needed
4. Displays status on ground crew tablets

**CG Limits During Loading:**
- Forward Limit: 19.5% MAC (45.0% - 2.5% margin)
- Aft Limit: 49.5% MAC (52.0% - 2.5% margin)
- Lateral Limit: ±0.5% of centerline

## 4. Optimized Loading Patterns

### 4.1 Standard Distribution (100 passengers)

```
OPTIMAL PASSENGER DISTRIBUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Section         | Target Load | Actual Range | CG Impact
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Forward (R1-4)  | 16%        | 14-18%      | -0.8% MAC
Mid Fwd (R5-12) | 35%        | 33-37%      | -0.2% MAC
Mid Aft (R13-20)| 35%        | 33-37%      | +0.3% MAC
Aft (R21-24)    | 14%        | 12-16%      | +0.7% MAC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.2 High-Density Loading (BWBQ100B - 150 passengers)

For high-density variant operations:
1. Enable all three boarding doors simultaneously
2. Implement "reverse pyramid" loading
3. Target 18-minute total boarding time
4. Monitor lateral balance more frequently

### 4.3 Quick Turnaround Loading (BWBQ100E)

For 25-minute turnarounds:
1. Pre-position ground equipment
2. Simultaneous deplaning/boarding via separate doors
3. No zone-based loading - free seating
4. QSM system in "rapid mode" with 10Hz updates

## 5. Special Loading Scenarios

### 5.1 Passengers Requiring Assistance

#### 5.1.1 Wheelchair Passengers
- Board first via Door 1L (closest to accessible lavatory)
- Maximum 4 wheelchair passengers per flight
- Transfer accomplished using onboard aisle chair
- Wheelchairs stored in forward cargo compartment

#### 5.1.2 Unaccompanied Minors
- Seated in rows 5-6 for optimal crew supervision
- Board with Zone 3
- Maximum 6 unaccompanied minors per flight

### 5.2 Irregular Operations

#### 5.2.1 Single Door Operations
If only one boarding door available:
1. Extend boarding time to 25 minutes
2. Load in strict aft-to-forward sequence
3. Monitor CG every 10 passengers
4. Consider fuel redistribution if needed

#### 5.2.2 Weight-Restricted Operations
When payload limited:
1. QPU calculates optimal seat blocking
2. Block seats symmetrically about centerline
3. Maintain minimum 20% load in each zone
4. Adjust fuel load for CG optimization

### 5.3 Charter/Group Loading

For large groups (>30 passengers):
1. Pre-assign seating by group
2. Board groups in separate zones
3. Balance group weight across aircraft
4. Consider group baggage concentration effects

## 6. Communication Protocols

### 6.1 Standard Phraseology

Ground crew must use standardized calls:
- "Zone [number] boarding commenced"
- "Zone [number] complete, [X] passengers"
- "Lateral imbalance detected, [left/right] heavy"
- "CG approaching limit, [forward/aft]"
- "Boarding complete, door [X] secure"

### 6.2 System Integration

The loading system interfaces with:
- **Departure Control System (DCS)**: Passenger count and seat assignments
- **Weight & Balance System**: Real-time CG calculation
- **QSM Network**: Structural load monitoring
- **Ground Operations Display**: Visual loading progress
- **Flight Deck**: CG position and trends

## 7. Contingency Procedures

### 7.1 CG Out of Limits

If CG exceeds limits during loading:

1. **STOP** boarding immediately
2. **ASSESS** current distribution via QPU analysis
3. **CALCULATE** required passenger movements
4. **IMPLEMENT** reassignments (typically 3-5 passengers)
5. **VERIFY** CG within limits
6. **RESUME** boarding

### 7.2 QSM System Failure

If quantum monitoring fails:
1. Revert to manual calculation methods
2. Apply conservative loading (center zones first)
3. Increase CG margin to 3.5% MAC
4. Verify final CG by three independent calculations

### 7.3 Rapid Deplaning Requirement

If emergency deplaning required during boarding:
1. Stop boarding immediately
2. Open all available doors
3. Deplane in reverse order (last on, first off)
4. Account for all passengers via DCS

## 8. Environmental Considerations

### 8.1 Weather Impacts

#### 8.1.1 High Winds (>25 knots)
- Reduce simultaneous door operations
- Increase lateral balance monitoring frequency
- Consider single-door loading from leeward side

#### 8.1.2 Precipitation
- Deploy door canopies before boarding
- Increase cabin floor cleaning frequency
- Allow extra time for passenger movement

### 8.2 Temperature Extremes

#### 8.2.1 Hot Weather (>35°C)
- Pre-cool cabin to 18°C
- Expedite boarding to minimize door-open time
- Monitor passenger comfort actively

#### 8.2.2 Cold Weather (<-10°C)
- Minimize door-open time
- Board via minimum doors necessary
- Ensure jet bridge heating operational
